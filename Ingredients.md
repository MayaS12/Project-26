Pizza ingredients:

1. 1/2 recipe homemade pizza dough
2. 1 Tablespoon olive oil
3. 2 cloves roasted garlic, finely chopped
4. 1/4 cup your favorite pizza or tomato sauce
5. 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced into 1/2 inch thick pieces
6. 2 plum tomatoes, sliced (or any tomato you like)
7. a handful of fresh basil
8. fresh ground black pepper, to taste

Dough ingredients:

1. Yeast: Instant yeast makes the job quicker. You need 1 standard packet.
2. Water: Use warm water to cut down on rise time, about 105ºF – 115ºF. Anything over 130ºF is too hot.
3. Flour: Use unbleached all-purpose white flour in the pizza crust. Bleaching the flour strips away some of the protein, which will affect how much water the flour absorbs.
4. Oil: Extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough. Don’t forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.
5. Salt: Adds flavor.
6. Sugar: A little sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the pizza dough.
7. Cornmeal: Use cornmeal to dust the pizza pan; it gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp.

Equipment:

1. Stand Mixer: An electric stand mixer is preferred for making homemade pizza crust, but you don’t *NEED* it. You can simply mix and knead the dough by hand.
2. Pizza Pan: Some pizza enthusiasts own pizza stones, baking stones, and pizza peels. If you have them– awesome. If you don’t, just use a regular pizza pan or a baking sheet.
3. Pizza Cutter: This OXO pizza cutter because it’s sharp, comfortable, and easy.
